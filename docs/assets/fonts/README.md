Notes:

- Fonts were downloaded from Google Fonts and stored locally to avoid external calls.
- Updated `docs/_sass/vendor/google/_fonts.scss` to prefer WOFF2 variants (where available) with TTF as a fallback and `font-display: swap` for better rendering.
- Multiple WOFF2 subset files were downloaded to improve performance and character coverage; these are stored in this folder.
