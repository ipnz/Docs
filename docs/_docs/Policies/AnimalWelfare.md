The Internet Party recognises the decades of scientific evidence, undertaken around the world, which proves animals are sentient beings (that animals can feel pain and distress). This concept of sentience (and the acceptance of) has also been recognised by many governments around the world. In order to be one of the global leaders in animal welfare therefore, New Zealand must ensure that this concept of sentience becomes an important foundation for the development of its protection policy for all animals â€“ companion, production, wild and exotic.

**The Internet Party will:**

- Animal cruelty should not be tolerated for economic practicality or impact. This includes the welfare of animals being compromised for entertainment. 
- Ban all live exports including export for slaughter and breeding (and close all loopholes that categorise "livestock"). This is a trade in suffering.
- Phase out 'Factory Farming' practices; stop any future 'intensive farming' (including the intensification of dairy) and help collaborate with the industry to promote humane and sustainable farming practices instead.  

**Further Details**

1. **Animal codes of welfare:** Animal welfare emergency management should also be included in all relevant regulations and codes of welfare - for both companion and production animals. 

2. **Live animal exports:** An explicit and total ban of animals for live export and breeding will give greater certainty and send a stronger message to the international community. A formal ban will also allow New Zealand to consolidate its focus as an exporter of high quality meat, and reflect to the world that the welfare of animals remains a priority for the people and the Government of New Zealand.  This ban must be worded and applied to all animals' not just 'livestock'.  

3. **Enforcement and Regulations:** As many of the existing minimum standards, which currently sit in the codes of welfare, should be translated into regulation. The SPCA should not be shouldered with the cost implications associated with enforcement (ie impounding animals of evidence) we would encourage greater Government support in this area. 

4. **Exotic and wild animals for public display:** Welfare standards for animals kept in captivity must be greatly improved. Private zoos and animal collectors should be prohibited from importing exotic animals. Publicly owned zoos should be prohibited from importing exotic animals unless there is a clear plan for a species recovery programme.  

Local authorities should not be able to import large mammals which require large living spaces and complex environments (ie elephants, lions, bears and large primates) for public zoos without the consent of the Government and following formal process of public consultation. The welfare of the animal should not be compromised in order to allow public access for entertainment purposes. The transferring of animals from public to private zoos should be expressly prohibited to close potential loopholes for public zoos. The use of exotic or wild animals in circuses must also be banned.

5. **Wild Animals:** No wild animal should be wilfully or recklessly ill-treated. This should include releasing animals from close confinement to be shot at. Guidelines regarding recreational mammal hunting should be developed to provide guidance to the industry. Again this will send a clear international signal that the welfare of our wildlife matters; thus promoting ethical tourism in New Zealand.   

6. **Animals for research, testing or teaching:** Animal testing of recreational products including psychoactive substances and cosmetics should be banned. India, Italy, Israel and all 28 countries of the European Union have banned testing on animal cosmetics. 

7. **The link between domestic violence and animal violence:** The extensive (local and international) research and evidence of the link between domestic and animal violence should be acknowledged. Support programs that promote respect and empathy towards humans and animals, at all levels of education should be encouraged and where possible Government subsidised. This could help make positive impact on the reduction of family violence in the long-term and a wider public understand that animal cruelty is not accepted.  

8. **National Parks, Reserves and Marine reserves** : No future exploration or mining permits should be issued for all National Parks, Reserves, and Marine reserves, regardless of protection status. In order to give the greatest protection to endangered wildlife.

9. **Commissioner of Animal Welfare:** A Commissioner of Animal Welfare should be established. This Commissioner should be independent of all political parties and from the MPI, and will report to parliament. This Commissioner should have the power to develop, implement and monitor codes of welfare as well as investigate on a complaint.
